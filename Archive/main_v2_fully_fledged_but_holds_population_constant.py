"""First draft of an evolution simulator code for KID Museum.

Generates zorks (winged giraffe-like animals) with random traits.  Grades each zork's survivability based on its
traits.  Culls zorks that fall below a certain threshold.  Zorks mate in random pairs to create new zorks.

New in this version of the code, zorks' likelihood to reproduce is proportional to their survivability rating minus the
threshold to survive.  Additionally, this version displays a single figure made up of subfigures, instead of displaying
multiple separate figures.

# Todos
    # Within the scope of KID Museum:
        # TODO: Figure out how kids can interact with it.  Is it a black box where they get to control parameters, and thus gain intuition about evolution?
        # TODO: Draw zorks graphically or build them in TinkerCAD codeblocks/something similar?
        # TODO: Make a nice GUI.
        # TODO: Control with potentiometers on an RPi?
        # TODO: Show graphs with an animation where the line draws in from left to right, to link the x-axis with time and aid kids without graph intuition.
        # TODO: New traits: Jaw muscle mass?  Fire breath Wattage?  What about a binary choice, like eye color, that doesn't influence survival, so that we can look at genetic drift?
    # Beyond the scope of KID Museum:
        # TODO: Let culling decision be based on not only survivability rating, but also random chance.  It shouldn't be fully predetermined whether a zork survives based on their traits.
        # TODO: Let culling threshold be based on current population, to mimic environmental capacity.  Include a user-set parameter called population_capacity, which determines what population causes the survival threshold to be unreasonably harsh.
        # TODO: Let the population change from generation to generation dynamically, instead of holding it constant.
        # TODO: Enable Monte Carlo style analysis, to observe the average statistics of many runs.
